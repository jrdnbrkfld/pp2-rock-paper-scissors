# Milestone Project 2 - Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
## Purpose
This website was created to complete the second Milestone Project for Code Insitute's Full Stack Software Developer course. I built this from the ground up using knowledge I gained from the previous modules. These being HTML, CSS, User Centric Design and JavaScript. The full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section further down.

Users of this website are able to challenge themselves to play against a computer, with the winner being declared when either one reaches a score of 5.
